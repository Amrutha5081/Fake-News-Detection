# Fake-News-Detection

Problem statement is the Identification of Online Fake Content. 
The main outcome is to build a solution that can identify fake content published online and shared on social media platforms, 
along with details of users who post such false information, given any text or URLs.

Approach towards the idea is mainly using LSTM in Deep learning. 
Deep learning is an advanced neural network technique with huge potential to impersonate the human brain.
We have added a feature that enables our program to retrieve data from the URL and provide accurate prediction,
given any regional languages as an input.
